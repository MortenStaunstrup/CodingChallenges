### MWC tool

**Use GNU compiler to compile the c program, place it in a path folder to use anywhere**

**Or use the .exe in folder to test on the .txt file**

Basic usage:
```
<exe name> -w <.txt file> 'counts the words'
<exe name> -c <.txt file> 'counts the bytes'
<exe name> -m <.txt file> 'counts the chars'
<exe name> -l <.txt file> 'counts the lines'
<exe name> <.txt file> 'counts all'
```

A simple MWC-clone, that outputs the words, bytes, chars and lines of a txt file.

### JSON-parser

**Use GNU compiler to compile...**

**Or use the .exe in folder to test on 2 test json files**

```
<exe name> <json file>
```

A JSON-parser that lexes chars into tokens, then parses them and validates correct formatting
